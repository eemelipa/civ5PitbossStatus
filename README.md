# civ5PitbossStatus
Script for publishing&amp;updating civilization 5 pitboss game status to a website.

The script monitors the blinking icons on civ 5 pitboss map view to infer which players haven't yet played. Use simultaneous turns since war declaration might otherwise change the ordering of player icons.

Screenshots are taken from the timer and the score screen.

How to get started:
1. Install AutoIt https://www.autoitscript.com/

2. Set up your pitboss running

3. Put the pitboss to map view

4. Set up the script (coords, player names, and your ip&s3 conf) 

5. run it with AutoIt
